    <h1> Early Heart Disease Detection using Heart Beat
        Sensing  </h1>

        <h2>Abstract </h2>
    <p>
        Heart infections impacts 70m people worldwide where a
considerable number of individuals donâ€™t have the foggiest idea
about the signs. In this we will fabricate a model of heart beat
distinguishing to fathom the condition of the heart by android
application. In this structure we are completing a heartbeat
checking and heart sickness (Heart attack) disclosure system
using the Internet of Things. The sensor is then interfaced to a
microcontroller that grants checking heart rate readings and
transmitting them over Internet. . The purpose of this errand is
that the customer can recognize his heart condition by sitting at
home.

          <h2>Introduction</h2>
         <p>One in each four demise are identified with heart. Heart attack can
            happen when the progression of blood to heart is blocked.
            Attributable to late finding of heart attack we are insufficient to
            spare the lives of numerous people This structure can recognize
            beat, temperature reliably with the help of sensor. Customer can
            set the breaking point for all parameters.

        <h2>Introduction to Heartbeat Sensor </h2>
        <p>Monitoring heart rate is very important for athletes, patients as it
            determines the condition of the heart (just heart rate). There are many
            ways to measure heart rate and the most precise one is using an
            Electrocardiography
            But the more easy way to monitor the heart rate is to use a Heartbeat
            Sensor. It comes in different shapes and sizes and allows an instant way
            to measure the heartbeat.
            Heartbeat Sensors are available in Wrist Watches (Smart Watches),
            Smart Phones, chest straps, etc. The heartbeat is measured in beats per
            minute or bpm, which indicates the number of times the heart is
            contracting or expanding in a minute.</p>

            <h2>Principle of Heartbeat Sensor</h2>
            <p>The principle behind the working of the Heartbeat Sensor is
                Photoplethysmograph. According to this principle, the changes in the
                volume of blood in an organ is measured by the changes in the intensity
                of the light passing through that organ.
                Usually, the source of light in a heartbeat sensor would be an IR LED
                and the detector would be any Photo Detector like a Photo Diode, an
                LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) or a Photo Transistor.
                With these two i.e. a light source and a detector, we can arrange them
                in two ways: A Transmissive Sensor and a Reflective Sensor.
                In a Transmissive Sensor, the light source and the detector are place
                facing each other and the finger of the person must be placed in
                between the transmitter and receiver.
                Reflective Sensor, on the other hand, has the light source and the
                detector adjacent to each other and the finger of the person must be
                placed in front of the sensor.</p>

                <h2>Components Required</h2>
                <p>Arduino UNO x 1</p>
                <p>Heartbeat Sensor</p>
                <p>Connecting wires</p>
                <hr>
                <hr>
                <p>Required libraries were added to the IDE and the data was
                    collected from the device and converted to heart beat rate in
                    format beats per minute. The module was connected to a hotspot
                    to access the internet and send the data to any remote server
                    anywhere in the world.</p>

                    <h2>Results and Discussion</h2>
                    <p>After implementation of this project, we can measure the heart
                        rate of the user taken from the heart beat sensor on our mobile
                        phone. The advantage of this system is that a person can
                        measure his/her heartbeat instantly and easily and can know the
                        value through his phone and is very cheap to its alternatives. A
                        person can also know the value sitting at a far-off place through
                        internet.</p>

                        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>We were able to achieve our target of displaying heart beat to the
                            users. The advantage Is easy to use and is a lot less expensive
                            than its alternatives. Every- thing worked correctly and the
                            correct value is displayed on the device through internet.</p>
